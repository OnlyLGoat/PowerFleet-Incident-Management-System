## Overview

Power Fleet IMS allows fleet management companies to track and manage incidents reported by their clients. Clients can register, report incidents on their vehicles, and track their resolution. Internal staff (technicians, support managers, admins) handle, assign, and resolve incidents with full role-based access control.

## Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns, structured strictly according to the UML specifications:

```
HTTP Request
    │
    ▼
Next.js App Router (app/api/*/route.ts)
    │
    ▼
JWT Auth Middleware (middleware/auth.ts)
    │  • Extracts & verifies Bearer token
    │  • Dynamically resolves subclass role presence
    │  • Injects user payload into request context
    │
    ▼
Route Handlers (app/api/*/route.ts)
    │  • Wrapped in withAudit to automatically log security events
    │  • Parse request body & Zod validation
    │  • Delegate to OOP Service classes
    │  • Return JSON responses
    │
    ▼
OOP Service Layer (lib/services/*)
    │  • Implemented as static-method classes
    │  • Enforces soft-delete & user status validations
    │  • Business logic & verification
    │  • Data access via Drizzle ORM
    │
    ▼
Database Layer (db/)
    │  • Drizzle ORM client
    │  • Class Table Inheritance (CTI) mappings
    │  • Relations for eager loading
    │
    ▼
PostgreSQL Database
```

## Database Schema

### Polymorphic Inheritance (CTI)
To satisfy strict role-less polymorphic inheritance requirements, the database contains **zero role string columns**. Instead, roles are resolved dynamically at runtime based on table presence (Class Table Inheritance):
*   `users` represents the abstract base entity.
*   `clients` and `internal_users` inherit from `users` (using their primary key as a foreign key pointing to `users.id`).
*   `admins`, `support_managers`, and `technicians` inherit from `internal_users`.

### Soft Delete Protocol & Global Visibility
Entity soft-deletion does not use redundant boolean columns. Instead, it relies purely on nullability checks on `deletedAt: timestamp`.
**Global Visibility Rule:** If an entity (Incident, Vehicle, Comment, Attachment, or Internal Note) is soft-deleted, it becomes strictly invisible to all users **except Admins**, deeply integrated directly into Drizzle ORM queries. Even original owners cannot view their soft-deleted items.

### Tables

| Table              | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `users`            | Base user table (abstract parent class)                      |
| `clients`          | Client company profile records                               |
| `internal_users`   | Base internal staff profiles (with `isActive` state check)   |
| `admins`           | System administrators (can manage users & close tickets)     |
| `support_managers` | Oversight managers (can assign incidents to technicians)     |
| `technicians`      | Technical resolvers (assigned to tickets, with availability) |
| `vehicles`         | Fleet vehicles (IMEI, license plate, registered owner)       |
| `incidents`        | Incident tickets with detailed SLA metrics                   |
| `incident_comments`| Comments on incidents with public/private visibility         |
| `incident_events`  | Timeline event logs representing audit logs history          |
| `incident_attachments` | Attachments uploaded by users (images/documents)           |
| `impact_links`     | Weight mapping indicating incident asset relationship links  |
| `generated_reports`| Generated reporting history log details                      |
| `security_audit_events` | Security access audit details                           |

## SLA (Service Level Agreement) Engine

The system features an automated Service Level Agreement (SLA) calculation engine. It evaluates tickets dynamically based on response and resolution milestone deadlines.

### Milestone Triggers
- **Response Deadline (`firstResponseAt`)**: Exclusively triggered when an internal staff member (`Admin`, `Support Manager`, or `Technician`) explicitly writes a comment on the ticket. Changes in status or ticket assignments *do not* artificially trigger response SLAs.
- **Resolution Deadline (`resolvedAt`)**: Triggered when the incident status is moved to `Resolved`.

### Due Date Offsets
| Priority | Response SLA Limit (From Creation) | Resolution SLA Limit (From First Response) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | `createdAt + 12 hours` | `firstResponseAt + 24 hours` |
| **Medium** | `createdAt + 6 hours` | `firstResponseAt + 12 hours` |
| **High** | `createdAt + 2 hours` | `firstResponseAt + 6 hours` |
| **Critical** | `createdAt + 30 minutes` | `firstResponseAt + 3 hours` |

### SLA Status States
1.  **Healthy:** Time remaining on pending milestone is above the warning thresholds.
2.  **Warning_Response:** Response is pending with warning time remaining.
3.  **Overdue_Response:** Response deadline missed; resolution is still within limits.
4.  **Warning_Resolution:** Response was met on time; resolution is pending with warning time remaining.
5.  **Overdue_Resolution:** Response was met on time; resolution deadline missed.
6.  **Overdue_Both:** Both response and resolution deadlines missed.
7.  **Met:** Both response and resolution limits successfully met on time.
8.  **Met_With_Response_Overdue:** Response deadline missed, but resolution met on time.
9.  **Met_With_Resolution_Overdue:** Response met on time, but resolution deadline missed.

---

## Role-Based Access Control

*   **ClientUser:** Can register, create incidents, view/comment on own incidents, change own comments visibility. Forbidden from filtering by internal metrics (e.g. `slaStatus`).
*   **Technician:** Can view/comment on assigned incidents, change own comments visibility, resolve incidents.
*   **SupportManager:** Can view all incidents, assign work, comment on any incident.
*   **Admin:** Full access, manage vehicles & users, comment on any incident, change any comment visibility.

- `?search=` (Matches `ID` exact or `Title` fuzzy)
- `?status=Open,Resolved`
- `?priority=High,Critical`
- `?type=GPS Device,Vehicle`
- `?slaStatus=Overdue_Both,Warning_Response` (Internal Users only)
- `?dateFrom=` & `?dateTo=` (ISO Strings)

| GET    | `/api/vehicles/:id`    | Get vehicle by ID        | Any authenticated |
| DELETE | `/api/vehicles/:id`    | Soft-delete a vehicle    | Admin             |

### Security & Audit Logs

| Method | Endpoint                            | Description                               | Role Required |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| GET    | `/api/securitylogs`                 | Fetch all global security audit logs      | Admin         |
| GET    | `/api/securitylogs/user/:id`        | Fetch security logs generated by a user   | Admin         |
| GET    | `/api/securitylogs/incident/:id`    | Fetch security logs targeting an incident | Admin         |

> **Note:** Security logging is now fully automated and centralized. API routes use a custom `withAudit` wrapper that catches successes and errors seamlessly and delegates them to the `SecurityAudit` service, eliminating try-catch boilerplate across endpoints.
